# 8051-python-simulator
Data Memory Simulator of 8051 Assembly codes

work class takes 3 parameters

work(mem,file,y)

mem is the first defined variables for example mem=['P2', 5] ,  so P2 will be 5 decimal value at startup of the program,
file is the asm file
y is the running cycles, how many times the code will run


word class returns memory array, you can see all the memories wich is changed by assembly code.
